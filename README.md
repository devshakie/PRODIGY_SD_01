# Temperature Conversion Program
## Overview
This project is a web application that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The user inputs a temperature value and the original unit of measurement, and the program converts the temperature to the other two units, displaying the results.

## Features
User Input Handling: Users can input a temperature value and select the original unit of measurement (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).  
Real-Time Conversion: The application converts the temperature into the other two units instantly upon user input.  
Responsive Design: The layout is responsive and visually appealing, providing a seamless user experience across different devices.  
Styling and Theming: Custom theming and styles enhance the visual aesthetics of the application.  
## Technologies Used
+ React: For building the user interface and managing state.
+ Material-UI: For creating a consistent and professional design with pre-built components.
+ JavaScript: For implementing the core logic of temperature conversion.
